# Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm Image Generation
This Python program demonstrates the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate an image using squares. The code takes an input image and evolves a population of squares to approximate it.

Description
The program creates a blank canvas and a population of squares, each represented by position, color, and opacity. The squares evolve over generations through mutation, and their collective appearance on the canvas approximates the input image.

Requirements
Python (3.x)
OpenCV (cv2 library, install using pip install opencv-python)

Instructions
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Place the input image (e.g., input_image.jpg) that you want to recreate in the same directory as the code.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code.

Run the Python script using the following command:

python test.py
The code will execute and display the canvas where squares evolve over generations to recreate the input image.

Adjust the number of generations and other parameters in the code to achieve the desired results.

Close the window when the program finishes executing.
